## Biography


I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests lie primarily in understanding and improving continuity, generalizability, efficiency and other key properties of machine learning. I'm also interested in vision-language and video models.

I'm also learning web development and building machine learning softwares and systems.
